I developed a Stopwatch App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web-based stopwatch allows users to start, pause, and reset the timer with a smooth and interactive interface. It displays minutes, seconds, and milliseconds in real-time and is designed to work seamlessly on different devices.

# Key Features:
Start, Pause, and Reset functionality for easy time tracking.
Real-time timer display with precise millisecond tracking.
User-friendly interface with a clean and modern design.
Fully responsive for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
# Technologies Used:
HTML for structure.
CSS for styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript for stopwatch logic and functionality.
