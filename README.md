I developed a Stopwatch App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web-based stopwatch allows users to start, pause, and reset the timer with a smooth and interactive interface. It displays minutes, seconds, and milliseconds in real-time and is designed to work seamlessly on different devices.

## Features

- **Start, Pause, and Reset functionality** for easy time tracking.
- **Real-time timer display** with precise millisecond tracking.
- **User-friendly interface** with a clean and modern design.
